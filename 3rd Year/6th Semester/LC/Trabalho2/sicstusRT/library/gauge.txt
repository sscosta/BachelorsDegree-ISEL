Guide to Gauge
==============

Buttons:

CALCULATE
Push the Calculate button to calculate the values according to the
current settings. The values are displayed in a histogram.

RESET COUNTERS
The execution counters of the displayed predicates and clauses may be
reset by pushing the "Reset Count" button.

PRINT
Open the printing dialog window. This allows printing the histogram
on any postscript printer, or to file. To print on non-postscript
printers, it is recommended to save to file and then print the
resulting postscript file, using for example Ghostscript.

QUIT
The Quit button quits Gauge and closes the gauge windows.


Settings:

SPECIFICATION
Calls - The number of times a predicate/clause was called.
Execution Time - The execution time. NOTE, this is a synthetic value.
Choice Points - Number of choice points actually created at clause entry.
Shallow Failures - Number of failures in the ``if'' part of
	if-then-else statements, or in the ``guard'' part of guarded clauses.
Deep Failures - Number of failures that don't count as shallow.
Backtracking - Number of times a clause was backtracked into.

RESOLUTION
Predicate - Compute results on a per predicate basis. Predicates are
	denoted by "Name/Arity".
Clause - Compute results on a per clause basis. Clauses are denoted by
	"Name/Arity/ClauseNumber".
User+System Clauses - Compute results on a per clause basis but show
	the system generated clauses as any other clause. Examples of
	system generated clauses are clauses for disjunction (a;b) and
	If-Then-Else (a->b;c). Those clauses are denoted as the user
	clauses, but with their names replaced by (MainClause-Number).
	Here MainClause is the "parent" clause and Number is the ordinal
	number of this generated predicate within the parent clause.

SORT ORDER
Alphabetic - Sort the bars in alphabetic order.
Descending values - Sort the bars by descending values.
Ascending values - Sort the bars by ascending values.
Top 40 - Show just the 40 highest values in descending order.

SCALE
Linear - Display values with a linear scale.
Logarithmic - Display values with a logarithmic scale.

SHOW
All - Show all values in the histogram.
No zero values - Show only non-zero values.

FONT
The font used in the histogram chart.

VALUE INFO
By clicking on the bars of the histogram, the figures are displayed in
the "Value Info" window.
